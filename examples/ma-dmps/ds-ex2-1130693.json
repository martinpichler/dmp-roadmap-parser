    "title": "Cryptocurrency Litecoin (LTC): Risk and Dependence Assessment - Detailed DMP",
    "description": "Abstract::Litecoin is one of the so-called Top-15 Altcoins by market capitalisation. Altcoins have grown massively in importance in the cryptosector over the last 2 years and have pushed Bitcoin's share of the total market capitalisation below 35% at least in the short term.  In addition to a general review of the Altcoin Litecoin (functionality, special features, pros/cons, price development ...), the aim of this paper is in particular a risk and dependency assessment of Litecoin. They therefore calculate and interpret correlations with traditional assets/asset classes or assess dependencies within the cryptospace (e.g. with Bitcoin or by compiling a crypto index) taking into account changes over time and examine to what extent it makes sense to consider the systematic risk of Litecoin.;Explain the relation to the objectives of the project::The goal of this project is to identify the risk of LTC. Is there a systematic risk? Is it changing over time? Or are newer Methods like Conditional Value at Risk more appropriate for measuring risk?;Outline the data utility: to whom will it be useful::Other Researchers, who want to estimate the risk for LTC.;Outline the approach towards search keyword::Not implemented.",
